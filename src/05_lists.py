# For the exercise, look up the methods and functions that are available for use
# with Python lists.

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [8, 9, 10]

# For the following, DO NOT USE AN ASSIGNMENT (=).

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4]
x.append(4)
print(x)

# Using y, change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]
# x.append(y) # This does add y to the x but adds it as an array inside the array
x.extend(y)
print(x)

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10]
x.remove(8)
print(x)

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 99, 10]
x.insert(5, 99)
print(x)

# Print the length of list x
print(len(x))

# Print all the values in x multiplied by 1000
# print(x * 1000) # This will print the list 1000 times

print([1000*i for i in x])
